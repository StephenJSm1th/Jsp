An example of a basic scraping script to automate checking a products price. It also emails me the info.

After purchasing a Jackery power station, I now want a solar panel to go with it.
This script is run as a cron job to automatically scrape the website once a day and email me the current price.
Which is currently Â£272.99.
As the site often has flash sales, I will put off buying one until the price drops.
